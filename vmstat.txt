       vvmmssttaatt  reports  information about processes, memory, paging, block IO,
       traps, and cpu activity.

       The first report produced gives averages since the last reboot.   Addi-
       tional  reports  give information on a sampling period of length _d_e_l_a_y.
       The process and memory reports are instantaneous in either case.

       The --aa switch displays active/inactive memory, given a 2.5.41 kernel or
       better.

       The  --ff  switch displays the number of forks since boot.  This includes
       the fork, vfork, and clone system calls, and is equivalent to the total
       number  of  tasks  created.  Each process is represented by one or more
       tasks, depending on thread usage.  This display does not repeat.

       The --tt switch adds timestamp to the output.

       The --mm switch displays slabinfo.

       The --nn switch causes the header to be displayed only once  rather  than
       periodically.

       The  --ss  switch  displays  a table of various event counters and memory
       statistics. This display does not repeat.

       _d_e_l_a_y is the delay between updates in seconds.  If no delay  is  speci-
       fied, only one report is printed with the average values since boot.

       _c_o_u_n_t  is the number of updates.  If no count is specified and delay is
       defined, _c_o_u_n_t defaults to infinity.

       The --dd reports disk statistics (2.5.70 or above required)

       The --ww enlarges field width for big memory sizes

       The --pp followed by some partition name for detailed statistics  (2.5.70
       or above required)

       The  --SS  followed  by  k  or K or m or M switches outputs between 1000,
       1024, 1000000, or 1048576 bytes

       The --VV switch results in displaying version information.

       vvmmssttaatt does not require special permissions.

       These reports are intended to help identify system bottlenecks.   Linux
       vvmmssttaatt does not count itself as a running process.

       All  linux  blocks  are  currently  1024  bytes. Old kernels may report
       blocks as 512 bytes, 2048 bytes, or 4096 bytes.

       Since procps 3.1.9, vmstat lets you choose units (k, K, m,  M)  default
       is K (1024 bytes) in the default mode

       vmstat uses slabinfo 1.1    FIXME
